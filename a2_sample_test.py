This module contains sample tests for Assignment 2.

Warning: This is an extremely incomplete set of tests!
Add your own to practice writing tests and to be confident your code is correct.

    This test relies on the sample_sentences.csv dataset. That file consists
    of just a few lines, but there are three important details to notice:

        1. You should use the second entry of each csv file as the weight of
           the sentence. This entry can be a float! (Don't assume it's an int.)
        2. The file contains two sentences that are sanitized to the same
           string, and so this value is inserted twice. This means its weight
           is the *sum* of the weights from each of the two lines in the file.
        3. Numbers *are allowed* in the strings (this is true for both types
           of text-based autocomplete engines). Don't remove them!
